# EMBSYS 310 - AU20
# ASSIGNMENT 08
## Goal
The goals for the assignment this week:
1. Explore the use of PWM on our STM32L475 Discovery board.
## Problems:
1. PWM
    a. Study the tutorial: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/STM32CubeMX_Tutorial_Series:_PWM

    b. Use the STM32CubeMx similar to what’s described in the tutorial to generate the code that connects one of the PWM channels to one of the user LEDs for our STM32 Discovery Board.

    c. Modify the code generated like the tutorial in order to control the LED blinking and brightness.

    d. Create a video demonstrating the brightness of the LED changing overtime.

    e. Submit your video along with your entire IAR project to your GitHub.

## What to turn in and how:
   - Check in all your homework in your repo under the folder “assignment08”.
   - Your folder should contain the following:
  
    o Turn in your entire project.

        **assignment08/led_pwm**

    o Turn in your video showing the brightness of the LED changing overtime.
